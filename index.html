            <h1>Development</h1>
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p> 
                I created an interactive interface through React using interactive interface
                components. I wanted to look at creating a clothing selection 
                similar to online shopping websites that have a favorite items
                list that users can add items to while they are browsing. 
                Additionally, my interface will be designed to have the ability
                to filter by type of clothing and color, as well as sort by 
                price or alphabetically. 
            </p>
            <h2>Competitive Analysis</h2>
            <p> 
                To start, I completed a competitive analysis to determine what 
                websites are already doing and to get design ideas for my website.
                I looked into three different websites: 
                
                <ul>
                    <li><a href="https://us.princesspolly.com/collections/clothing">PrincessPolly</a></li>
                    <li><a href="https://www.pacsun.com/womens/">Pacsun</a></li>
                    <li><a href="https://www.garageclothing.com/ca/g/clothing/">Garage</a></li>
                  </ul>

                I analyzed the "favorite" feature on all three websites to create
                the competitve comparison chart below. 
                
                <img src="competitive chart.png" alt="Competitive Analysis Chart">
            
                When evaluating how PrincessPolly, Pacsun, and Garage&#39;s websites 
                organize and display their favorites, I came across many key 
                observations. PrincessPolly and Garage both have visible hearts 
                on the top right corner of the picture of each item that the user 
                can click to add the item to their favorites, while on Pacsun&#39;s 
                interface, you have to hover over the item for a heart to show 
                up in the top right corner for the user to click and add the 
                item to their favorites. The visible hearts already on the items 
                are successful because it is easy to find and the user does not 
                have to search how to add something to their favorites list. On 
                all three websites, once you click the heart, it fills in red, 
                indicating that the item is in the favorites list. PrincessPolly 
                does not require an account to make a cart, but both Pacsun and 
                Garage require sign in into an account. After clicking the heart 
                icon to add to favorites, PrincessPolly prompts the user to add 
                the item to a current list or create a new list to organize the 
                favorites. You cannot create lists for the favorites on Pacsun 
                or Garage. This is a nice feature to create multiple lists of 
                favorites, as well as keeping favorites more organized. To 
                remove an item from the list, Pacun has a button that says 
                &#39;Remove&#39; and Garage has an &#39;X&#39; symbol that the 
                user can click. To remove an item from the list on PrincessPolly, 
                you have to click the heart in the top right corner to unfill 
                the color. Having visible ways to remove the product from the 
                list is useful because the user does not need to search for a 
                way to remove an item from the list. PrincessPolly requires 
                users to enter the size and color of the product when adding 
                to a list, Garage does not require it but the user can input 
                sizes to keep in their favorites list, and Pacsun does not have
                 an option to add sizes of products. PrincessPolly and Garage both
                 have options to edit the sizes and colors of their items
                  directly from the favorites list. These features are nice to 
                  have, but not necessarily needed because someone doesn&#39;t 
                  always know their size when they are liking items. Garage has 
                  the best system for this because the user can add things to 
                  their favorites with or without sizes. The items are organized 
                  alphabetically on PrincessPolly, most recent like at the top 
                  to least recent like at the bottom of the page on Pacsun, and 
                  least recent like at the top to most recent like at the bottom 
                  on Garage. Since Pacsun and Garage&#39;s interfaces have a 
                  chronological flow, it is easier to find newly added items 
                  whose names might be hard to remember by going to the place 
                  in the list that contains the most recent addition. 

            </p>

            <p>
                I identified the following features I wanted to include in my design:
                <ul>
                    <li>Visible button to click to add to favorites list that changes when the item is in the list</li>
                    <li>Obivious Remove button for the list</li>
                    <li>Organize least recent to most recent</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <h2>
                The Design Process
            </h2>
            <p>
                To start, I knew that I wanted to include some specific features
                in my design. Some of these features include two filtering 
                categories, at least one sorting feature, an aggregaor, a 
                reset button to remove filters and sorts, at least 12 items
                that I can display that have a button to add them to the favorites
                list. 
            </p>
            <p>
                I used React components to create the filtering and sorting, as 
                well as creating an item list that holds the items added to the 
                favorites list. I then added the functionality in the app by
                creating functions to handle the changes made by pressing buttons.

                What I Learned:
            </h2>
            <p>
                This process allowed me to gain valuable insights on how to use
                React and create an interactive display that dynamically interacts
                with items on the screen related to filters and sorting options
                applied, as well as adding things to their favorites list. Using
                React proved to be useful in handling different functionalities
                of features. This process led to valuable insights on front-end 
                engineering that will allow me to better collaborate with different 
                teams of designers and developers in the future.
